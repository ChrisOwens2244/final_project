# Chris Owens Triple Ten Final Project: News Explorer

This project is a demonstartation of the skill that Christopher Owens has learned over the course of the Triple Ten Software Development Bootcamp. What is shown is a website that allows a user to access news articles sourced from an API by typeing in a keyword. Then, if the user is logged into the site, they will be able to save an article along with the keyword it was found with, and access this article on a page that shows the users saved pages.
